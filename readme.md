# Retrieving Reviews:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/retrive.json
User can retrieve only their reviews by sending a GET request to this link with the authentication token in the header.

# Admin view:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
I have used Djangoâ€™s default admin view to provide admin access to all reviews, users and companies.  
Username	: admin
Password	:P@ssw0rd
Additional admin users can of course be created using python manage.py createsuperuser.

# Web UI: 
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
I have also made a full website where the users can register and login and interactively submit reviews and look at their reviews. 
Authentication token is automatically generated for each user and can be viewed by the use on their profile page.
